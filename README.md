With the increasing shift towards online grocery shopping, consumers often face the challenge of spending excessive time browsing through countless product options across multiple categories. This not only makes the shopping experience tedious but also overwhelming, particularly when users have a budget in mind and wish to stick to it. While many platforms offer chatbots to assist with general queries, few provide curated shopping solutions that cater specifically to user preferences and budgets.

Our project addresses this gap by creating a smart grocery shopping chatbot that simplifies the entire process. By offering premade, budget-curated lists for essential grocery categories—such as dairy, fruits and vegetables, snacks, and packaged food—the chatbot eliminates the hassle of selecting products individually. Users are presented with three budget options for each category (under ₹200, under ₹750, and above ₹750) or the option to skip a category altogether. Once the selections are made, an order summary is generated, and the chatbot provides a direct link to shop all the selected products on a popular online shopping platform. Additionally, the chatbot can answer user queries related to nutrition tips, making the shopping experience not only efficient but also informative.

This solution provides a seamless, personalized shopping experience, making online grocery shopping faster, easier, and more intuitive.
